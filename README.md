# Terraform Playground  
  
Welcome to my Terraform Playground! This repo is a space where I can experiment  
with different applications of Terraform, a popular infrastructure as code tool.  
  
## What is Terraform?  
  
Terraform is an open-source tool developed by HashiCorp that allows you to create, manage,  
and update infrastructure resources in a declarative way. With Terraform, you can define your  
infrastructure as code, which allows you to version control it, share it, and collaborate on it  
with others.  
  
## What will you find in this repo?  
  
In this repo, you will find various Terraform scripts that I have created to test  
out different applications of Terraform. Right now, I have a script I've found useful
for Ansible testing because it quickly builds and tears down EC2 instances.

I'm sure there will be more to come! â˜•
