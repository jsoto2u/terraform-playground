# Terraform Playground  
  
Welcome to my Terraform Playground! This repo is a space where I can experiment  
with different applications of Terraform, a popular infrastructure as code tool.  
  
# What is Terraform?  
  
Terraform is an open-source tool developed by HashiCorp that allows you to create, manage,  
and update infrastructure resources in a declarative way. With Terraform, you can define your  
infrastructure as code, which allows you to version control it, share it, and collaborate on it  
with others.  
  
# What will you find in this repo?  
  
In this repo, you will find various Terraform modules and configurations that I have created to test  
out different applications of Terraform. It is going to be messy for a while, until I have more time.
  
I'll make sure to organize it at some point. Until then, cheers! â˜•
